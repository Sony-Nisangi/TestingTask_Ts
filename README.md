# Additional checks to add to the current tests
    - For title check test case, right now the validation is just to check whether the title exists or not. The test case can be further improved by testing the title relevance and whether it matches with the content.
    - For the grade visibility test case, enhance the test case to check if the grade is below or equal to 5 and read the text under the review (i.e Sehr gut) and assess it.
    - for the 2 start filter test case, enhance the test case to check the count of reviews as well (i.e 2 star has 55 reviews).

# Further possible test cases
    - Check all the links are properly working (such as link on the logo of trustedshops & Jalousiescout, infomation, profile logo etc..)
    - Check if the login works (for private or business customers)
    - Validation of user input fields (such as search boxes)
    - check if all the filter dropdown values are properly navigating to relevant reviews filtering
    - Check if the sorting works (such as newest or relevance)
    - Check if all the positive or critical reviews displayed upon the click on respective links
    - Check if the report review opens the reporting modal dialog page
    - Check if the click on helpful shows the number 1 in green color next to it
    - Check if the link "So stellen wir sicher" is properly navigating to the relevant information.
    - Check if the link "Nach oben" navigates to the top
    - Check the page behavior for all the above testcases on different devices such as tablets or mobiles
