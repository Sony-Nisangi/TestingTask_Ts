Below is the plan for the described scenarios and summary for the team. 
For all the cases the commnication with in the team or between developers and QA is most important.

# 1. Approach and Plan
  - Regarding disabling the tests to fasten the release:
  		There will be lot of issues with skipping the tests such as bugs will be delivered to the customers, loss of reputation as well as money. 
		
		- Introduing testing as early as possible (in parallel to the development) and collaborating with developers can help the team in the early detection of the bugs. It can save the testing time.

  - Missing deadlines because of fixing bugs: 
		Postponing the bug fixing can have propagation of bugs and affects the product stability. 

		- Plan the development cycle by keeping time for the bug fixing, include the left over bugs from last cycle or from backlog if any into the planning. This helps team in achieving the goals.

  - Task done status:

		- Discuss and define the "Defination of done(DoD)" criteria for each task in the planning itself to avoid the confusions.
		- Discuss about any discrepencies on DOD criteria in the standup meetings in each development cycle 

  - Code rework:
  		 Discuss on the root cause of the rework.

		if rework is due to bugs
			- Spend time in discussing the requirements together with all the team members involving.
		if the rework is due to code quality
			- Improve the code review prorcess or metrics
			- Establish code quality guideline or certain CI/CD tools
  
  - Code quality time:
		 Maintainance of messy code is hectic, rework or feature extension requires lot of effort and money.

		 - Allocate a sprint/development cycle in regular intervals just for improving the code quality.
		 - Establish code quality guidelines or CI/CD tools.
		 - Provide necessary trainings to the developers in advance.
  
  - Slow system over the time

		 - Check whats causing the system slowness, use tools if and when necessary.
		 - Start performance testing as early as possible.
		 - Regularly check the performance of the whole system.

# 2. Summary

	Hello Team, I am thrilled to join the team. I have noticed several issues that have been affecting our product development process and i would like to propose a plan to address these issues collaboratively to ensure that we improe our efficiency, code quality and overall performance.

		The sprint/development cycles from now on will have time aside for the bug fixing. Each task in the sprint will have a definition of done criteria to avoid the confusions in the end. We will discuss the requirements with in the team for each task clearly to avoid the rework. We will try to introduce testing in parallel with development process, enhance the communication between developers and QA to reduce the bugs. To reduce the code rework , we will define clear code guidelines to improve the code quality. we will have necessary trainings on improving the code reviews and code quality in the team. We will also introduce the code quality control tools in our CI/CD infrastructure. We will also keep a sprint just to address the code quality issues in regular intervals. To address the performace of the product, we will start performace testing as early as possible and regularly monitor the performance issues if any.
	
	By implementing these measures, we can enhance our development process, deliver higher-quality products, and improve customer satisfaction. I believe that with your support and collaboration, we can achieve these goals and establish a stronger foundation for our team's success.
