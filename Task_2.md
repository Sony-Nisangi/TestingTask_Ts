Below is the plan for the described scenarios and summary for the team.

# 1. Approach and Plan
  - Regarding disabling the tests to fasten the release:
  		There will be lot of issues with skipping the tests such as bugs will be delivered to the customers, loss of reputation as well as money. 
			Introduing testing as early as possible (in parallel to the development) and collaborating with developers can save the testing time and early detection of the bugs.
